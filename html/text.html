        <h2>chapter 1</h2>
        <p>molly has been staring oout of her window for about an hour now. on her disk,lying between
            the copies of <i>nature,</i> <i>new scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeard
            in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>on the road.</cite> it had been molly's favourite book since college,
            and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>she had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an oscar wilde
            quote proclaiming that <q>work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do,</q>
            although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama 
            <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement,molly
            <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
